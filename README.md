# Description

Using the sequelize module and MySQL as a base, this back-end project supports the ecommerce site, which stores merchandise. This allows the using to create, update and delete date, while providing a unique id to each. Technologies used were: 

* Javascript 
* Express
* npm modules
* Run tests using nmp jest
* Timely commits to GitHub repository to save work


Working the back-end elements for this e-commerce website, provided a lot of experience using sequelize and exposed me to its powerful and effective features.
